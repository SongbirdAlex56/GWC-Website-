      <h2>Why does this Matter? </h2>
        <p>
          The people working in STEM fields need to represent society as a whole. STEM is here to build a more diverse, accessible future. Black women need to become apart of this. In the 2017-2018 school year, black women earned only 2.9% of Bachelor's degrees across all STEM fields.
