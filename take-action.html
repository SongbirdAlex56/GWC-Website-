    <p>Here are just some ideas from acadmeic articles for how to increase the number of black women in STEM</p>

    <br/>

    <ul class="resources">
      <li><a href="https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/voices/where-are-the-black-women-in-stem-leadership/">Where Are the Black Women in STEM Leadership?</a>. "One solution is to create more diversity and inclusivity in emerging technologies by preparing underrepresented women already in STEM for roles in leadership."
</li>
      <li><a href="https://facultyresourcenetwork.org/publications/advancing-women-and-the-underrepresented-in-the-academy/advancement-of-women-of-color-in-science-technology-engineering-and-math-stem-disciplines/">ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN OF COLOR IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATH (STEM) DISCIPLINES/</a>."Organizations should seek to increase the number and percentage of women of color employees, provide mentors, ensure salary equity by gender and race, and create a supportive work culture by training, employees,  managers, administrators and the likes on the benefits of developing a culturally aware organization.""
</li>
      <li><a href="https://facultyresourcenetwork.org/publications/advancing-women-and-the-underrepresented-in-the-academy/advancement-of-women-of-color-in-science-technology-engineering-and-math-stem-disciplines/">ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN OF COLOR IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATH (STEM) DISCIPLINES</a>. "African American women must create internal and external networks that help them to navigate through the system. African American women should serve as mentors to one another by reaching inside themselves and giving back to those who come behind them."" 
</li>
    </ul>
<h2>The Struggles</h2>
Here are just some of the reasons why there is such a low number of black women in STEM fields. 

<br/>

    <ul class="resources">
      <li><a href="https://facultyresourcenetwork.org/publications/advancing-women-and-the-underrepresented-in-the-academy/advancement-of-women-of-color-in-science-technology-engineering-and-math-stem-disciplines/">ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN OF COLOR IN SCIENCE, TECHNOLOGY, ENGINEERING, AND MATH (STEM) DISCIPLINES</a>. "Being part of a network increases information and knowledge, resulting in an increase in the chances of advancement in the STEM disciplines. African American women are often excluded from networks and isolated in the work environment."
</li>
      <li><a href="http://www.scientistafoundation.com/scientista-spotlights/why-so-few-african-american-women-in-stem-part-ii-by-the-numbers">Why So Few? African American Women in STEM - Part II: By the Numbers/</a>."An understanding of “why so few” African American women earning (advanced) degrees in STEM and working in S&E cannot be fully appreciated without understanding the history of Black women in higher education and efforts to create access to science programs." For decades, black women have been shut out of higher education, because of this, there has not been many oppertunities for advancement until very recently. 
</li>
      <li><a href="https://stateofopportunity.michiganradio.org/post/why-are-there-so-few-women-color-stem-careers">Why are there so few women of color in STEM careers?</a>. "The presence of women in STEM presents unique internal challenges. Women in these fields are faced with the issues of salary disparity, under representation, gender stereotyping, a sense that their ideas are not taken seriously, being overlooked for promotions, inadequate mentors and exclusion from informal networks. Women of color face additional challenges because of their race, gender, and cultural differences as well as questioning of technical capability and competence." Along with being discriminated because of gender, black women also have to deal with race discrimination on top of that.

    </ul>

		<h2>Call Your School District Superintendent!</h2>

		<p>
			Exposing students to STEM fields early on gives them access and insight into possible careers. This starts with your own school. Call your school discricts superintendent to ask about the STEM programs going on in your district. 
			<a href="https://www.edutopia.org/blog/5-ways-girls-involved-STEM-karen-purcell"> 5 Ways to Get Girls into STEM.</a>."Administrators and educators must strive to create environments in high school and college math and science programs that are inviting to females if we want to prevent the likelihood of their choosing a different direction. As long as young boys and girls are exposed to science and technology and are equally encouraged to study those disciplines, those with talent and a genuine interest in those fields will be able to develop that interest."

			 Call your School District Superintendent to ask them about the advancement of STEM programs at your school. Urge them to continue them, expand, or start!
